# DND-Game
A simple turn-based Java adventure game. Code by Jackson Oliva.

You play a frog, enslaved and emprisoned. Escape your confines and claim your sweet revenge!

Controls:

WASD / Arrow Keys = Move/Attack

Spacebar = Charge weapon / Pass turn

Z and X = Swap inventory slots

Enter = Use currently highlighted inventory item

Backspace = Drop currently highlighted inventory item

Shift = Swap between primary/secondary weapon

Control Key = Pass Turn (Without charging weapon)

M = Display the area map

F9 = Load the game! [IMPORTANT]

-----------------------------------

Tips:

Everything is turn-based. Moving, attacking, or using an item will cost you a turn and allow the enemies to move!

Charged attacks will not occur unless you attack the immediate next turn after charging.

Use the mouse to highlight enemies or objects before engaging.

Hit Save Crystals to save your game's progress and heal a bit.

If you die or quit the game, you can continue your progress from a save point by loading with 'F9'.

If you are lost, pull up the area map with 'M' to see your location.
