# DND-Game
A simple turn-based Java adventure game. Music and character pain sound borrowed from Doom (1993) by ID Software. Sound sources taken and modified from freesound.org.

Controls:

WASD / Arrow Keys = Move/Attack

Spacebar = Charge weapon / Pass turn

Z and X = Swap inventory slots

Enter = Use currently highlighted inventory item

Backspace = Permanently discard currently highlighted inventory item

Shift = Swap between primary/secondary weapon

Control Key = Pass Turn (Without charging weapon)

F9 = Load the game! [IMPORTANT]

-----------------------------------

Tips:

Everything is turn-based. All actions consume a turn except discarding and navigating the inventory.

Charged attacks will not occur unless you attack the immediate next turn after charging.

Use the mouse to highlight enemies or objects before engaging
