# DND-Game
A simple turn-based Java adventure game. Code by Jackson Oliva.

You play a frog, enslaved and imprisoned. Escape your confines and claim your sweet revenge!

Controls:

WASD / Arrow Keys = Move/Attack

Spacebar = Charge weapons / Pass turn

Z and X = Swap inventory slots

Enter = Use currently highlighted inventory item

Backspace = Drop currently highlighted inventory item

Shift = Swap between primary/secondary weapon

Control Key = Pass Turn (Without charging weapons)

M = Display/Hide the area map

F9 = Load the game! [IMPORTANT]

-----------------------------------

Tips:

Everything is turn-based. Moving, attacking, charging your weapons, or using an item will cost you a turn and allow the enemies to move next!

Charge your weapons to prepare a special attack for next turn or activate special weapon abilities! Moving after charging will cancel the charge.

Use the mouse to highlight enemies and items to get a better grasp of your environment.

Hit Save Crystals to save your game's progress. These crystals also heal your character a bit!

If you die or quit the game, you can continue your progress from a save point by loading with 'F9'.

If you are lost, pull up the area map with 'M' to see your location. Green marks your current location, while blue marks screens you have explored.
